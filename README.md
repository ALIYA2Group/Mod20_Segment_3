# Mod20_Segment_3
During this segment, all of the individual pieces we've been building will come together. Once we have assembled these pieces, then we can start putting the final touches on the repository. Does the README.md fully describe the project and its purpose? Is the repository ready to be added to your portfolio? Details like these are part of "plugging it in" because each piece is vital to the final presentation.

# Purpose

Third Segment: Plug It In:Â Connect your final database to your model, continue to train your model, and create your dashboard and presentation.

# Presentation 
Content
The presentation tells a story about the project and includes the following:
* Selected topic
![P1](https://github.com/ALIYA2Group/Mod20_Segment_3/blob/main/Pictures/P1.PNG)
* Reason topic was selected
* Description of the source of data
* Questions the team hopes to answer with the data
![P4](https://github.com/ALIYA2Group/Mod20_Segment_3/blob/main/Pictures/P4.PNG)
* Description of the data exploration phase of the project
![P5](https://github.com/ALIYA2Group/Mod20_Segment_3/blob/main/Pictures/P5.PNG)
* Description of the analysis phase of the project

* Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project
Slides
Presentations are drafted in Google Slides.

* creating a presentation draft on Google slides, creating a dashboard, and completing quality assurance checks.
* Team: Continue to develop and refine the code for your analysis.
* Square: Complete peer reviews on the code.
* Triangle: Create a draft presentation to share with your class.
* Circle: Create a dashboard to display your findings. 
* X: Perform a quality assurance check on project deliverables against rubric requirements, and test the code.

# Github 
Main Branch
All code in the main branch is production-ready.
main branch should include:
* All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
* Most code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of the project
README.md
README.md should include:
* Description of the communication protocols has been removed
* Cohesive, structured outline of the project (this may include images, but they should be easy to follow and digest)
* Link to Google Slides draft presentation
The descriptions and explanations required in the project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.
Individual Branches
Requirements for the individual branches follow:
* At least one branch for each team member
* Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the third segment (12 total commits per person)

# Machine Learning Model

Students will be expected to submit the working code for their machine learning model, as well as the following:
* Description of data preprocessing
````
````
* Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the decision-making process

![M2](https://github.com/ALIYA2Group/Mod20_Segment_3/blob/main/Pictures/M2.PNG)

* Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
* Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
* Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)
* Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place
* Description of current accuracy score

Additionally, the model obviously addresses the question or problem the team is solving.


# Database Integration 

There are no deliverables for the database integration section of the project for this segment.

# Dashboard

The dashboard presents a data story that is logical and easy to follow for someone unfamiliar with the topic. It includes the following:
* Images from the initial analysis
* Data (images or report) from the machine learning task
* At least one interactive element
