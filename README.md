# Mod20_Segment_3
During this segment, all of the individual pieces we've been building will come together. Once we have assembled these pieces, then we can start putting the final touches on the repository. Does the README.md fully describe the project and its purpose? Is the repository ready to be added to your portfolio? Details like these are part of "plugging it in" because each piece is vital to the final presentation.

# Purpose

Third Segment: Plug It In:Â Connect your final database to your model, continue to train your model, and create your dashboard and presentation.

# Presentation

## Selected topic

We want to see if we could predict the mealting of Artic Sea Ice using time series predictive model SARIMAX for Time series prediction using Python.

![P1](https://github.com/ALIYA2Group/Mod20_Segment_3/blob/main/Pictures/P1.PNG)

## Reason topic was selected

We selected this topic becuase we wanted to predict at what point in time would the sea ice shrink.

## Description of the source of data

After reviewing the source data from the following resources; 

[National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)](http://nsidc.org/data/google_earth)

[Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/119111)

[Visualize Arctic and Antarctic Sea Ice](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/sea-ice/)

## Here is the Question the team hopes to answer with the data

> Based on past features of science exploration and calculation on melting and atmosphere changes we extracted, transformed and loaded the selected trends to show the sea-ice diminishing from 2003-2020 to try and predict at what point in time in the future these factors would impact the melting of the arctic sea ice extent.

## Description of the data exploration phase of the project

* Extract

Thru data exploration we determined that we wanted to use Artic data only, because it will melt faster than Antartica.

## Description of the analysis phase of the project and data processing

* Transform
 
When we transformed the features of the data set that were applicable we review the feature trends. 

![M2](https://github.com/ALIYA2Group/Mod20_Segment_3/blob/main/Pictures/M2.PNG)

Thru this we had to understand the significant of the science behind the data, to understand which features of the data set we needed to use.

* Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project

Presentations are drafted in Google Slides.


# Github 
Main Branch
All code in the main branch is production-ready.
main branch should include:
* All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
* Most code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of the project
README.md
README.md should include:
* Description of the communication protocols has been removed
* Cohesive, structured outline of the project (this may include images, but they should be easy to follow and digest)
* Link to Google Slides draft presentation
The descriptions and explanations required in the project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.
Individual Branches
Requirements for the individual branches follow:
* At least one branch for each team member
* Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the third segment (12 total commits per person)

# Machine Learning Model

Working code for our machine learning model is as follows;

* Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the decision-making process

* Description of how data was split into training and testing sets

* Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits

* Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)

* Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place

* Description of current accuracy score

Additionally, the model obviously addresses the question or problem the team is solving.


# Database Integration 

There are no deliverables for the database integration section of the project for this segment.

# Dashboard

## [Link to Dashboard](https://aliya2group.github.io/Mod20_Segment_3/)

The dashboard presents a data story that is logical and easy to follow for someone unfamiliar with the topic. It includes the following:

Future Predection:

![F10a](https://github.com/ALIYA2Group/Mod20_Segment_3/blob/main/Pictures/F10a.PNG)

* At least one interactive element, Yes.
* Data (images or report) from the machine learning task
* Images from the initial analysis
