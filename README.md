# Mod20_Segment_3
During this segment, all of the individual pieces we've been building will come together. Once we have assembled these pieces, then we can start putting the final touches on the repository. Does the README.md fully describe the project and its purpose? Is the repository ready to be added to your portfolio? Details like these are part of "plugging it in" because each piece is vital to the final presentation.
